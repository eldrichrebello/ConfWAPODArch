Conference Paper WAPOD Architecture

Low-frequency, electromechanically induced, inter-area oscillations are posing an increasing threat to the stability of the modern, interconnected power grid. Wide Area Monitoring, Protection and Control (WAMPAC) systems based on wide-area measurements such as synchrophasor (C37.118) data can be deployed to address the inter-area oscillation problem. This work develops a hardware prototype of a synchrophasor-based oscillation damping control system. A Compact Reconfigurable Input Output (cRIO) controller from National Instruments is used to develop the real-time prototype. This paper presents the design process followed for the development of the software architecture. The three step process followed viz. design proposal, design refinement and finally attempted implementation is detailed. The goals of the design, the challenges faced and the refinements necessary are also presented. The design implemented is tested and validated on OPAL RT's e\textsc{megasim} real-time simulation platform and a brief discussion of the results is also included.
