% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

The Phasor Power Oscillation Damping (Phasor POD) algorithm has been demonstrated to be effective at damping inter-area power system oscillations. Present implementations of the algorithm have been either in offline or real-time \textsc{Simulink} simulations. Previous research has demonstrated that wide-area signals are effective at achieving enhanced damping of inter-area modes. This work documents the design proposal and revision process for a real-time hardware prototype of the Phasor-POD algorithm on a Compact Reconfigurable Input Output (cRIO) controller from National Instruments. The real-world applicability of this design and the challenges faced together with the solutions implemented are also investigated.

%The modern power grid is increasingly being used under operating conditions of increasing stress for which it was not designed. The increasing penetration levels of variable energy sources such as wind present significant grid stability issues. One of these stability issues is the phenomenon of low frequency, electro-mechanically induced, inter-area oscillations. Simulations have demonstrated the potential of Wide Area Measurement Signals (WAMS)-based Power Oscillation Damping (POD) in achieving improved electromechanical mode damping compared to traditional, local signal based, Power System Stabilizers (PSS). This paper documents the software architecture that was envisaged, refined and finally implemented in the development of a real-time implementation of the Phasor-Power Oscillation Damper (Phasor POD).Tests were conducted to verify the working and performance of the real-time algorithm implementation. The challenges faced and the solutions implemented are also documented here.

\section{Introduction}
The goal of this paper is to document the architecture development process and challenges faced in the real-time implementation of \"{A}ngquist and Gama's\cite{PhasorPOD} Phasor Power Oscillation (Phasor POD) algorithm. For purposes of comparison, the real-time \textsc{Simulink} implementation of the Phasor POD algorithm by Almas and Vanfretti \cite{PhasorPODImplement} is used as a benchmark. The performance of the hardware prototype developed will be tested and compared to the performance of this implementation of the algorithm. The two-area four-machine model developed by Klein, Rogers and Kundur \cite{KundurTwoArea} is used as a test-case and is modified slightly to fit the requirements of this work. A Hardware-in-the-loop setup is constructed around the e\textsc{MEGASIM} real-time simulator from OPAL-RT \cite{OPALemegasim} with the two-area model running in real-time and a synchrophasor-based Phasor-POD algorithm running on a cRIO.

\section{Architecture Implementation and Refinement}

Figure \ref{fig:RevisionFlow} shows a three stage design process with design proposal, implementation and revision. To begin with, only the controller specifications were available. These were used to draft a design proposal. An implementation attempt was made using this draft proposal. When the additional limits imposed by the software and hardware platforms were included, some goals of the original code would have to revised. With these limitations, the original design was modified to generate a revised design. An attempt was then made to implement this revised design. If further limitations were encountered, the design was further modified. This iterative process was repeated till a working implementation was reached.\\



\subsubsection{Initial Design}
%\begin{figure}[htb]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./InitialArch}
%\caption{Initial Software Architecture}
%\label{fig:InitialArch}
%\end{figure}

Initially, the goal was to keep the controller (the cRIO) independent of any other devices. Such a controller would be able to take synchrophasor data (in the C37.118 format) directly from the network and extract measurement data. The architecture block diagram is shown in Figure  \ref{fig:InitialArch}. This controller was completely autonomous, with automated signal selection and processing. This design would be able to compute observability indices for the different input signals and then automatically select the one with the highest observability of a particular mode. This design also incorporated two control functions, a wide area control function and a local control function. The wide area control function selected for implementation was an inter-area oscillation damping control algorithm. The local control function would use locally available data and implement the control function in a manner similar to a Power System Stabiliser (PSS). Automatic switching between the two functions was also considered. If the signal to noise ratio in the wide area signal deteriorated or if the signal delay became prohibitively high, the controller would switch to the local signal or a back-up wide area signal automatically. The principal consideration in this design was the limited resources available on the FPGA and the complexity of the algorithms to be implemented. This required implementation of all algorithms and computation sections on the RT section of the cRIO. In addition, the RT controller has tremendous flexibility as algorithms are implemented using software, rather than hardware as on the FPGA. The RT controller also has more storage space available to implement algorithms. The trade-off was computation speed.\\

This design was faced with a problem of differing loop rates. The real-time simulator runs at a 50$\mu$s time step. The RT controller on the cRIO is not capable of matching this speed. The fastest that it could run was 1ms. To address this issue, this architecture envisaged using the FPGA to perform interpolation between successive data points. The FPGA would run at a loop rate of 50 microseconds, to match the real-time simulator. The region between successive data points was to be interpolated using a suitable interpolation algorithm. Data generated by the FPGA was to be sent over the communication network back to the real-time simulator for use in the simulation.\\

This design was changed due to limitations of different components. One, no software was available to read a synchrophasor stream on the RT controller and extract measurement data from the stream. This process had to be performed on a desktop computer running a real-time data mediator and LabVIEW.\\

Two, data generated by the FPGA could not be sent to the real-time simulator directly over the communication network. Though possible, further work is required.\\

Three, the process of data interpolation on the FPGA is complex. To achieve results better than with a simple linear interpolation, a history of past data points is required. This process is in itself complex and also introduces further delay. However, it is simpler than implementing the damping control algorithm on the FPGA. At this stage, FPGA limitations were the principal factor behind implementing the oscillation damping algorithm on the RT  controller.\\

\subsubsection{Development and Revision}

%\begin{figure}[htb]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./Revision}
%\caption{Revised Architecture}
%\label{fig:Revision}
%\end{figure}

With the limitations of the initial architecture in mind, it was revised. In this architecture, the process of  extracting data from the synchrophasor stream was shifted to a workstation computer. The process of signal selection and signal processing was also moved to this computer. Once data was available, it would be sent to the RT controller, over a communication network. The damping control was kept on the RT  controller with the FPGA performing the interpolation required to match the read-interval of the real-time simulator. Besides the damping control algorithm, a local control function was maintained on the RT controller. This revision is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Revision}.\\

Here, the complexity of implementing an interpolation algorithm on the FPGA was examined. It was realised that a simple linear interpolation algorithm would not be sufficient. Further, the FPGA output was limited by the speed of the RT controller as new data would only be available after a minimum of 1ms at the earliest (if the RT controller were to run at its maximum speed).\\

An implementation of the damping control algorithm on the RT controller was also tested. The fastest execution speed that could be achieved was in excess of 25ms. This was slower than the reporting rate of the PMUs.\\

Communication between the cRIO and the RT simulator using TCP/IP was also abandoned. Output values of the FPGA were instead hardwired to the real-time simulator's analogue inputs.\\

\subsubsection{Final Implementation}

%\begin{figure}[htb]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./Final}
%\caption{Final Software Architecture as Implemented}
%\label{fig:Final}
%\end{figure}


At this stage, the damping control algorithm was moved to the FPGA with the RT controller being used only for network communication and data monitoring. The local control function was also discarded as it was found to reduce the response speed of the RT  controller. If needed, the local control function can be implemented on the FPGA. The FPGA is suited to tasks that are repetitive in nature. The FPGA also has a fast and predictable response time. With the oscillation damping algorithm implemented on the FPGA, resource utilization stood at 78\%. Space is still available if further functions need to be implemented on the FPGA. As with the previous design, the process of extracting data from the synchrophasor stream was done on a workstation computer. Signal selection and processing was also done on this computer. This was the final architecture as implemented.\\
